| Concept      | Should Be Separate?      | Why                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| User         | ✅ Base identity and auth | Shared across all roles                  |
| Application  | ✅ Separate collection    | Role-specific to applicants              |
| Admin Info   | ✅ Optional profile       | Different fields, access                 |
| Mentor Info  | ✅ Optional profile       | Different from student                   |
| LMS Tracking | ✅ StudentProfile         | Isolated from auth and application logic |
